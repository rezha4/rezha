## Init

DayForge is made with tech I know (Next.js) and a service I think I know (Supabase). The purpose is to combine a couple of my little helpers (or micro-SaaS if you will): FocusTimer + Calendabit, into an actual SaaS.

![focus timer homepage](focustimer.png)
[FocusTimer](https://focustimerr.netlify.app/) is a Pomodoro timer web app, where you focus for _x_ minutes and then get breaks for _y_ minutes (determined by _x_ / how many minutes you work).

![calendabit homepage](calendabit.png)
[Calendabit](https://calendabit.netlify.app/) is my own digital solution, turning pen-and-paper calendar-habit tracking into a website.

I first thought of making another app: a daily journaling app and a Kanban to track my ever-flowing side projects.

Instead, I decided to combine it all into one app, and why not go the full length and try to market it like an actual SaaS?

Thus came out the unnamed project I initially called Command Center, then with a little thought, I named it DayForge (forge the life you want, one day at a time).

## Tech Decision

I decided to go with Next because that’s the devil I know, and chose Supabase because at least I’ve used Firebase in production (but avoided Firebase because of the vendor lock-in possibility). That’s why I said that I think I know this tech (Supabase), because I never actually used it intensively.

## **(Vibe) Coding**

Coding began, or at least it was the AI who coded it. I still use the old method of back-and-forth copy-paste between browser-based LLMs (Claude, Perplexity, and ChatGPT) and VS Code.

I chose this route probably because I was exhausted after coding in my day job, or maybe because I was lazy overall—because this project took an embarrassingly long time to take off.

## **Vibe Code Clean-Up Specialist**

Now the prototype has been up and running, not yet sharing it but I promise to release it in a few more weeks.

Another problem occurred: as the codebase grows, the complexity goes up too, and AI-generated code only halts progress.

Now the clean-up begins and actual code needs to be written.

## What’s Next?

I will now put serious commitment and hours into DayForge, at least making it presentable enough to be shared to the public.

I don’t expect too much in terms of it making money, so it will be free through and through, I am happy enough if there’ll be 3+ people actually using this and find it helpful lmao.
